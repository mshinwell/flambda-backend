  (* Here the join should give us a type for [g] that is a known closure, with
     its code ID being the common ancestor between the two branches, i.e. the
     original code ID from [A] for the anonymous function. The new code IDs
     created in each branch do not need the [x] value slot, as it is a known
     constant in both cases, but the ancestor still needs it.

     This test will fail if we remove the value slot [x] from the closure
     allocations in the branches. (Note that inlining [g] would introduce a
     projection in this compilation unit, which would obviously ensure that we
     don't remove the value slot). *)
